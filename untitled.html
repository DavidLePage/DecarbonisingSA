Not only does this revolution promise to deliver a far more environmentally healthy energy sector, but it could also usher in a new era of safe and stable energy supplies without the human and social costs of fossil fuels, such as perilous and unhealthy mining operations, economic instability and resource wars. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Yet, despite these compelling factors, almost every investment fund in South Africa forces us, the public, to continue to invest in fossil fuels. And despite its ostensible commitments to international agreements on climate change, the South African government continues, in many respects, to support a fossil fuel-intensive development model, while offering substantial subsidies to fossil fuels. <br></div><div><br></div><div>If we lived in the 19th century, it would be like being forced to invest in slavery and the horse trade. <br></div><div><br></div><div>### Climate change<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### The context for climate change<br></div><div><br></div><div>Our lives are a mostly invisible and glorious symphony played by a multitude of hidden and now profoundly threatened orchestras, from the bacteria that digest our food to the oceanic phytoplankton that replenish oxygen in the air we breathe. We depend on a stable environment and flow of constant flow of key resources, particularly water and food, to remain alive. In modern cultures, these resources find their way to us through a multitude of complex social and technological systems that, because of their complexity and energy intensity, are more vulnerable to breakdown than they may appear.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The high-consumption lifestyle that many are living and many more aspire to, depends on a level of consumption that can no longer be sustained without critically damaging Earth’s ‘life support systems’. It has been calculated by the Global Footprint Network that human civilisation over-stepped the biocapacity of the planet at some point in the 1980s. Since then, we have been living in overshoot:<br></div><div><br></div><div>&gt; Today humanity uses the equivalent of 1.6 planets to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste. This means it now takes the Earth one year and six months to regenerate what we use in a year.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This overshoot shows itself in the destruction of soils, forests, fisheries, the extinction of species, and the depletion of key non-renewable resources such as phosphorus. We are even running out of a resource that most of us would assume is unlimited: sand (Beiser, 2016). <br></div><div><br></div><div>The various dimensions of ecological damage have been described within the framework of a [‘safe operating space for humanity’](<a href="http://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html">http://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html</a>), the boundaries of which must be respected if humanity is to continue flourishing. <br></div><div><br></div><div>If we are to turn away from causing the biophysical decline of ‘Spaceship Earth’, and the social chaos it is already bringing, there are arguably three vital global transformations that are required. These have been summarised by Johan Rockström (2014), one of the leading authors of the ‘planetary boundaries’ framework, as:<br></div><div><br></div><div>- Sustainable food systems<br></div><div>- A fossil fuel-free world economy<br></div><div>- Transition to a circular economy<br></div><div><br></div><div>We might perhaps add to that: a more widespread culture of human respect for life and living systems. <br></div><div><br></div><div>One of the most critical areas of damage to the environment is permanent damage to a key factor that has allowed the development of human civilisation: a stable climate, now threatened principally by the burning of oil, gas and coal, and land-use change.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The rest of this paper will concentrate on why fossil fuels need to be replaced globally and in South Africa; current obstacles to the replacement of fossil fuels; and the alternatives to fossil fuels.<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### The causes of climate change<br></div><div><br></div><div>Greenhouse gases are those gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water vapour, that trap heat in the atmosphere. There are natural and human sources of greenhouse gases. <br></div><div><br></div><div>The natural balance of greenhouse gases is a good thing: it has kept the temperature of the Earth stable at levels mostly comfortable for human development over the past 10,000 years. Without natural greenhouse gases, Earth’s average surface temperature would be -18°C (Ma 1998). (On Venus, where the atmosphere is mostly CO₂, the surface temperature exceeds 400°C.)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Before the Industrial Revolution, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was around 280 parts per million. However, over the past 200 years, human activity has driven that level to over 400 parts per million.<br></div><div><br></div><div>/A similar trend has been observed globally.JPG (Increasing levels of atmospheric CO₂, as measured at Cape Point between 1993-2002. By 2016, levels had increased beyond 400 parts per million.

Average global temperatures have increased nearly one degree. <br></div><div><br></div><div>{insert graph of temperature increases}<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### The human ‘fingerprint’ on CO₂<br></div><div>There are a number of ways in which it can be determined that human activity is responsible for increased warming. These include:<br></div><div><br></div><div>- The isotopic form of additional CO₂ in the atmosphere is consistent with that found in fossil fuels. <br></div><div>- Atmospheric oxygen is declining as carbon is burned.<br></div><div>- Increased solar activity would cause warming throughout the atmosphere, but in fact the lower levels of the atmosphere are warming, as the upper levels cool, consistent with warming from increased greenhouse gases.<br></div><div>- Coral records over the past few centuries show a sharp increase in the amount of fossil fuel-typical carbon. <br></div><div>- Less heat is escaping to space at the wavelengths absorbed by CO₂.<br></div><div>- The amount of CO₂ dissolved in the ocean is increasing sharply, causing the seas to become more acid, and threatening marine food chains.<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### The global risks from burning fossil fuels due to climate change<br></div><div><br></div><div>The risks of climate change include increased levels of extreme weather such as storms, floods, droughts, sea-level rise and heat waves. These shifting weather events can have knock-on effects on existing natural systems, causing deforestation, melting permafrost, wild fires, decreased crop yields, accelerated glacial and snowpack melt, changes in ocean circulatory systems (in turn affecting weather patterns), threats to biodiversity, migration of marine and terrestrial wild life, shifting patterns of disease. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are also causing ocean acidification, threatening marine food chains. <br></div><div><br></div><div>It is important to appreciate that climate change is not just a future risk: it is already creating significant environmental, economic, social and human costs. <br></div><div><br></div><div>&lt;div class="atlas-chart" data-id="N1TIXjyrx" data-width="640" data-height="326"&gt;&lt;img src="<a href="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_N1TIXjyrx.png">https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_N1TIXjyrx.png</a>" style="max-width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src="<a href="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js">https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js</a>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Already estimated damage runs to... {climate vulnerability monitor}<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### Runaway global warming<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is a significant risk that the collective effect of human-induced warming will catalyse natural processes that will accelerate the warming process:<br></div><div>- Global warming has already reduced the amount of snow and ice in the Arctic. Because that ice and snow normally reflects a significant amount of heat back into space, the reduction in ice increases the amount of heat being retained. <br></div><div>-&nbsp; Another example is the likely accelerated release natural methane deposits previously permafrost and undersea. Methane is also a greenhouse gas, and when added to the atmosphere, accelerates existing warming. <br></div><div>-&nbsp; Another example is deforestation —&nbsp;as temperatures rise, forests are more likely to burn, in turn adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, creating further warming. These “feedbacks” mutually accelerate each other, creating the risk of “runaway” global warming. <br></div><div><br></div><div>These are but a few examples. <br></div><div><br></div><div>{insert quote about runaway global warming} <br></div><div><br></div><div>#### Social risks of climate change<br></div><div><br></div><div>The political and social impacts of climate change are already unfolding. There is good reason to think that climate change has been a substantial contribution to war and instability in both Darfur and Syria; and to African migration into Western Europe (Baker, 2015).<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### The full economic consequences of climate change are either misunderstood or denied<br></div><div><br></div><div>The leading climate economist Nicholas Nicholas Stern, who convened the British government’s landmark 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, has pointed out (2016) that: <br></div><div><br></div><div>&gt; As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged, published [social cost of carbon] estimates ‘lie between a few dollars and several hundreds of dollars’. These values often depend crucially on the ‘discounting’ used to translate future costs to current dollars. The high discount rates that predominate essentially assume that benefits to people in the future are much less important than benefits today. [So] most current models of climate-change impacts make two flawed assumptions: that people will be much wealthier in the future and that lives in the future are less important than lives now.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Mark New (Fossil Free UCT, 2014) of the African Climate Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town explains that while economists’ models of future economic impacts discount the future costs of climate change, reality does not discount, but increases costs. The actual costs of our present use of fossil fuels increase into the future, as the external costs of current fossil fuel usage emerge:<br></div><div><br></div><div>&gt;As the impacts of climate change that we are committing to now through not reducing emissions continue to get larger and larger, either the damages or the costs of adaptation continue to get larger. So we have this increasing interest rate that we’re going to be paying further and further into the future.”<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### Systemic threats of climate change<br></div><div><br></div><div>While economic modeling may anticipate some of the direct risks to economic systems and development, it is more likely that current economic modeling does not fully account for the complex inter-relationships between human society, the economy and the environment that supports them. On this subject, it is worth quoting Stern (2016) at length: <br></div><div><br></div><div>&gt;Current economic models tend to underestimate seriously both the potential impacts of dangerous climate change and the wider benefits of a transition to low-carbon growth... Many estimates of economic losses are based on the outputs of integrated assessment models (IAMs). These models attempt to combine the key elements of biophysical and economic systems... Sadly, most IAMs struggle to incorporate the scale of the scientific risks, such as the thawing of permafrost, release of methane, and other potential tipping points. Furthermore, many of the largest potential impacts are omitted, such as widespread conflict as a result of large-scale human migration to escape the worst-affected areas.<br></div><div><br></div><div>What’s more, climate change is not the only major stress on the human environment; it is just one of the stresses that is closest to critical levels.<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### What do current levels of climate change mean for Africa?<br></div><div><br></div><div>According to New (Fossil Free UCT, 2014) two degrees of global warming by 2100 would mean an average three degrees of warming for Africa, because continents warm more than oceans, and drier regions warm faster than wetter regions. In a four-degree warming scenario, Africa faces warming of six or more degrees. “A two degree policy target or a four degree outcome actually means even more significant impacts on the African continent.” This has to be set against a likely doubling of population by 2050, the only continent facing such a demographic boom. <br></div><div><br></div><div>In agriculture, four degrees of warming would mean that maize could no longer be grown in South Africa, and some areas would no longer be cultivable. The 10-15 year droughts that already afflict African rangeland regions would come every two years. New says that dealing with such changes is beyond the scope of technologies such as genetically modified organisms. New also says (and this was in 2014 before new studies suggesting greater possible sea level rise had emerged) that two degrees of warming would mean half a metre of sea level rise by 2100; four degrees would mean a metre of sea-level rise.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In a four-degree world, according to New:<br></div><div>&gt; The Cape Flats disappears… it either has to be protected or starts eroding away or disappearing. <br></div><div><br></div><div>&gt; … it means ripping up every single tarred road in South Africa and replacing it with something that doesn’t melt.<br></div><div><br></div><div>&gt; … it means rebuilding our built environment to cope.<br></div><div><br></div><div>### Non-climate impacts of the fossil fuel industry <br></div><div><br></div><div>Climate may have become the key danger of using fossil fuels, but it is far from being the only danger of using fossil fuels. Other associated risks include:<br></div><div><br></div><div>- **Air pollution:** The World Health Organisation estimates there are at least seven million annual deaths globally due to air pollution, though this figure includes very large numbers of deaths from indoor wood-burning. A recent OECD report (Roy 2016) estimated that annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution in South Africa are as high as 10,432. Coal smoke can also cause birth defects. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Tragically, “the people that are exposed to the smog are almost always the people that cannot afford to pay the doctors' bills for bronchitis, asthma or, worse, lung cancer”, as South African environment minister Edna Molewa observed in 2013. <br></div><div><br></div><div>The cost of premature deaths due to air pollution in South Africa has been calculated by the Global Commission on Economy and Climate as close to 1% of GDP annually. Air pollution also damages crop yields, halving yields at times in parts of India. <br></div><div>- **Water pollution:** It is difficult to quantify the full impacts of acid mining drainage from coal mining in South Africa, but coal mining has so polluted the Olifants River that Eskom can no longer use river water in its coal power stations (Colvin, 2011).[^Cited in a presentation by Robyn Hugo, Centre for Environmental Rights at the Life After Coal seminar, November 2016.]<br></div><div>-&nbsp; **Threats to arable land:** 46% of South Africa’s arable land is in Mpumalanga, and of that, 26% is threatened by coal mining.[^ Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy, cited by Tracey Davies, Centre for Environmental Rights.]<br></div><div>- **Distortion of climate science by fossil fuel companies:** The fossil fuel industry has, over the past 30 years, mounted a systematic campaign to obscure the science of climate change and mislead the public about the link between human activity and global warming. In 2006, the prestigious British Royal Society publicly requested Exxon Mobil to cease its funding of climate denial (Royal Society, 2006). In 2013, the Guardian reported that between 2002 and 2010, ‘anonymous billionaires had donated $120m to more than 100 anti-climate groups working to discredit climate change science’. In 2015, the attorney general of New York opened an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil had lied to the public about the causes of climate change (Gillis and Krauss, 2015). <br></div><div>- **Corruption:** The corruption sponsored by the fossil fuel industry goes far beyond attempts to corrupt science. Examples abound. In Nigeria, Shell has infiltrated most government ministries (Smith, 2010). In the US, fossil fuel companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to subvert democracy and limit regulation of their industry (Cray and Montague, 2014). Most recently, in South Africa, the Public Protector’s 2016 report on ‘State capture’ indicated that undue influence probably played a role when the Tegeta coal mine owned by Oakbay Resources secured extraordinarily favourable terms in a deal to supply Eskom’s Arnot Power Station (Karim, 2016). The state oil company, PetroSA, has been at the centre of a series of scandals (amaBhungane, 2013).<br></div><div>- **Economic risk from fossil fuels:** Oil price changes, in the current global food system, can bring sharp increases in food and transport costs, with particularly unpleasant consequences for the poor. <br></div><div>- **War:** In 2014, conflicts in no less than seven regions and countries could be linked to oil (Klare, 2014). Though other pretexts were used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, amongst others, was clear that seizing Iraq’s oil was the real reason for invasion (Beaumont and Walters, 2007).<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### Non-climate impacts from fossil fuels: Mpumalanga<br></div><div><br></div><div>A case study in the cumulative non-climate impacts of fossil fuels can be seen in South Africa’s Mpumalanga province (Benchmarks Foundation, 2014). <br></div><div><br></div><div>In Mpumalanga, the impacts of the fossil fuel industry include destruction of roads, protests over mining companies’ broken promises, lack of community trust in mining companies, increased unemployment as capital intensive mining replaces agriculture, devaluation of farm land and increased respiratory problems. The severe disruption of local communities also includes increased migration, increased crime, and increased HIV/AIDS.<br></div><div><br></div><div>{insert images of coal impacts on Mpumalanga}<br></div><div><br></div><div>### The financial risks of the fossil fuel economy<br></div><div><br></div><div>Coal remains a significant export earner for South Africa, now more important than gold. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Even if South Africa neglects to immediately reduce its domestic coal usage, many other countries are moving fast towards decarbonisation, and South Africa’s export earnings from coal risk sharp decline. South Africa needs to prepare for the potential loss of earnings from coal by planning a ‘just transition’ for the coal and energy sectors, as are countries like Germany. <br></div><div><br></div><div>##### Relative contributions of gold and coal to SA’s economy (StatsSA, 2015)<br></div><div>|---|---|---|<br></div><div>||1993|2013|<br></div><div>|Coal|R37bn|R51bn|<br></div><div>|Gold|R115bn|R31bn|<br></div><div><br></div><div>Some might interpret this table as indicating that coal is essential to South Africa’s economy. However, another lesson that can be drawn from it –&nbsp;specifically, the decline of the gold industry –&nbsp;is the danger of economic dependence on non-renewable resources. The value of coal to the economy also neglects to factor in its costs. <br></div><div><br></div><div>- Cross border tariffs<br></div><div>- Stranded assets<br></div><div><br></div><div>### The benefits of decarbonisation<br></div><div><br></div><div>From this analysis of the dangers of fossil fuels, we can easily list the benefits of decarbonisation:<br></div><div><br></div><div>- A more stable climate climate <br></div><div>- Cleaner air and water<br></div><div>- Reduced threats to arable land<br></div><div>- Increased energy and water security<br></div><div>- Increased biodiversity<br></div><div>- Reduced pressure on public expenses<br></div><div><br></div><div>### Renewable energy and jobs<br></div><div><br></div><div>- Increased jobs and rural development<br></div><div><br></div><div>- Reduced resource wars<br></div><div><br></div><div>This is what the Pear Energy team headed by Robert Pollin, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, had to say: "Specifically, spending $1 million on clean energy investments generates about 17 jobs across all sectors of the U.S. economy, while spending the same $1 million on maintaining the existing fossil fuel infrastructure produces only about five jobs.”<br></div><div><br></div><div>“In short, the clean energy investment agenda creates more jobs, better jobs, and a broader distribution of opportunity across wages and skill levels.” (Pollin 2014: 29) <br></div><div><br></div><div>- Reducing financial risk to savers and investors<br></div><div>- Reducing trade (possible tariffs on embedded carbon) and technological risk<br></div><div><br></div><div>#### Renewable energy in South Africa is now half the cost of coal and nuclear, and creates more jobs<br></div><div><br></div><div>In South Africa, the RE industry has created 35,000 operational jobs in the past five years (Moyo, 2016).

The cost of wind energy fell from R1.15/kwh in Round 1 to R0.62/kwh in Round 4. These costs are almost half the tariff prices for coal from independent power producers (R1.03/kwh), Eskom coal (R1.05/kwh to R1.16/kwh), and nuclear power, which is estimated at between R1.17kwh to R1.30/kwh. <br></div><div><br></div><div>### Extent of known fossil fuel subsidies in SA<br></div><div>- State support in various forms<br></div><div>- Support of Eskom for fossil fuel industry<br></div><div>- Opportunity cost of fossil fuel subsidies, ie loss to public purse<br></div><div>- ‘We can reduce extreme global poverty by three-fourths — right now [by ending fossil fuel subsidies]’.
